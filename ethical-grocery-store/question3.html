            <h1>A love that Pollutes Dilemma</h1>
            <p>
                The love of your life and parent to your 5 children has a severe chronic illness that requires specific medications.  
                These medications are obtained by mass destruction and pollution to the environment on an unearthly level.<br><br>
                
                Would you, as a partner and parent, allow your loved one to continue treatment,  
                so that they could live a long life with you and your family, in a world full of chaos and pollution?  
                <br>
                OR
                <br>
                Would you allow your children to live out their lives in a healthy and blissful environment,  
                without the upbringing of their other parent?
