      <h1>The Other You</h1>
      <p>
        You meet someone identical to you — same life, same mind, same start.<br><br>
        But every moral decision you made, they chose the opposite.<br>
        They walked away when you stayed.<br>
        They betrayed someone you protected.<br>
        They kept secrets you exposed.<br><br>
        And they’re thriving. They sleep soundly.<br>
        They say: <i>“I did what was right. You just wanted to feel right.”</i><br><br>
        Suddenly, everything you built your sense of self on — your sacrifices, your principles — feels fragile.<br><br>
        You could open your mind, admit your morals are just one version of the truth.  
        But if you do... what was the point of all your pain?
